      <h2><em><strong>Welcome to my Flex Page!</strong></em></h2>
      <p>
        3 things in life I want to flex, it is my family,my friends and also my achievements in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        first family, I am so lucky that I have them,everytime I have a problems in life, They are on my side.
        I'm also lucky because they love me,they always teach me what is right or wrong,they also care about
        myself,they prayed for me and more, that's why I want to flex them cause I'm greatful to have them.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Second is my friends, friends is also my second brothers and sisters. I want to flex them because I'm
        very thankful to God because, He gaves me a circle of friends Who always cares,they also support  me on
        my dream,they  listens to my problems, tells stories through that person we like, and more and I'm so
        very proud because I met them..

        Third is my achievements, one thing that I have been proud of to myself is ,I graduated last year 2022-2023
        in Bukidnon National High School.because graduating is the best achievements in life,and  
        That's the best event I've ever attended.
